# edit with dials

Quick and dirty editor for assigning physical dials to game values and editing at run time.

Settings can also be saved/loaded as json for future use.

Dials are on akai fire midi controller, see here for more info https://github.com/owlbee/akai-fire-hx

## sample

There is a flixel sample with some bindings set up.

To use the editor you need to build targeting window/linux at this stage. And there is not much point running it unless you have an akai fire controller though.
